Link to Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/

Type: Easy

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.
 

## __Example 1:__

    Input: x = 121

    Output: true
## __Example 2:__
    
    Input: x = -121

    Output: false

    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## __Example 3:__

    Input: x = 10

    Output: false

    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## __Example 4:__
    
    Input: x = -101

    Output: false

## __Constraints:__

    -231 <= x <= 231 - 1
